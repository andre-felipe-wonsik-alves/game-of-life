The source code was heavily inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQhi2w1E0iU) from hamsterbyte. His implementation can be found at the following link: [https://github.com/hamsterbyte/Godot-4-Conways-Game-Of-Life](https://github.com/hamsterbyte/Godot-4-Conways-Game-Of-Life).  
I learned the camera implementation from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWCFcv_Poc0) by Real Robots.
